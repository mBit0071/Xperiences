Angeles National forest has miles of mountain roads to play for automotive enthusiasts. This incident happened on Mt Wilson Red Box Road. I have been to these road multiple times and each time I try to push the car to it's limits. 

Earlier I had pushed Toyota Corolla to it's absolute limit and the little Corolla (E170) did great until it started flashing warning "Please take a break" with a coffee mug next to it. The brakes were not responding well, the tires were screeching way too much and the car felt very stiff. That's when I decided to stop and let the car cool down a bit. After 15-20 minutes of rest the little E170 was great again. On this particular day, I had a 2020 Nissan Altima S (L34). Being a front wheel drive (FWD) there is not much to drift with in Altima, but I had sometime to kill so there I was pushing the limits of L34. I was not trying to intentionally drift and trying to have fun in curvy mountain roads.

Drifiting started in Japan in the mountain roads by people trying to go through a corner minimum loss of speed.

Wikipedia defines drifting as:
```
Drifting is a driving technique where the driver intentionally oversteers, with loss of traction, while maintaining control and driving the car through the entirety of a corner. 
```

Keywords here: "oversteers" and "loss of traction". Altima again being FWD has loads of understeer and being *new* tires (the particular car had only 7000 miles on it) has ABS which should maintain traction all the time. I guess I should switch off traction control next time I push the limits.

Anyways, while going to Mt Wilson observatory everything is fine, the car is doing alright, traction is good, it is just struggling as the engine is crappy and transmission is so slow. But I get to the end and snap the below picture.

Now I am heading back to the Angeles Crest highway, so I can hit my usual spots. Turn 1, good, Turn 2 good, turn 3, I was a little late and there was no speed warning signs. So, I am halfway in the turn still accelerating and I realize, maybe I am going to fast. And snap, I am in lift off oversteer.

```
Lift-off oversteer (also known as snap-oversteer, trailing-throttle oversteer, throttle off oversteer, or lift-throttle oversteer) is a form of oversteer in automobiles that occurs while cornering when closing the throttle.
....
Lift-off (Snap) oversteer is induced when the throttle is lifted while midway through a corner (lift-off oversteer), often by inexperienced drivers trying to reduce speed after braking too little.

```

Basically, I felt lift off oversteer for the first time in my life. The feeling was like experiencing snow for the first time. The inertia of the vehicle was pushing it out of corner (massive understeer) which was expected as this was FWD, but as soon as the acceleration stopped, the fairly even weight distribution gets disturbed and weight shifts to the front axle, the rear tires lost traction and because front tires were still gripping hard (the engine being on front aided this traction) causing the vehicle to oversteer. At this moment I am heading towards the rock face of cliff and I am in opposite lane. My instincts kick in and I start counter steering, which I overdo and now I am heading towards the ditch. Another round of counter steer was enough to bring control back in my hand and the following picture was taken right after this hair raising incident.

This happened so fast that I did not really understand the gravity of the situation and even while taking the above photo I am still catching up with the emotions. It was only after 30 minutes of driving I realized that what had happened and how dangerous it was.

Upon further retrospection, I have so many questions.

1. Lift-off oversteer is experienced in mid engine cars. L34 is front engine vehicle. How did I feel such a brutual oversteer?
1. Did the traction control aid or exacerbated the situation? Normally it should have cut power to get more grip. But could it have cut too much power and I would have dragged the rear wheel if traction control was off? 
1. Would gentlty lifting accelerator work? I tried going through a corner fast in Joshua Tree National park and it did drag the rear wheels. Granted I did not leave accelerator completely. Have I mastered lift-off oversteer?

Going back to the definition of drifting, if I learn lift-off oversteer intentionally, I am drifting a FWD car.
