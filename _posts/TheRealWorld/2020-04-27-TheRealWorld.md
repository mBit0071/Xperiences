Grand central market (GCM) is in Downtown Los Angeles and in my opinion, has most diverse cuisines per sq inch of all of Los Angeles. You can find everything from PB&J to Tacos, Ramen to Pasta, Bratwurst to noodles and Pizza to Burgers. GCM is a tight place and each restaurant is competing fiercely. 

GCM has Olio's pizza which serves wood fired pizza baked in what looks like a very fancy oven for relatively cheap price. The pizza's are not big but are very tasty. On this particular day, GCM was very crowded.

GCM is generally crowded, but I usually do not visit GCM on weekends or holidays. I visit on weekdays, when I think it would not be very busy.

So, I order the pizza and start looking for a place to sit. After I get the pizza and grab a seat near a ramen place. This ramen place was serving in a bar style, meaning the cook is right in front of you while you are eating. The cook (I am guessing here, it might just be a worker) got me a glass of water.

This felt wrong on multiple levels. First, I am occupying a place in his restaurant space denying him other customers. Second, I am eating pizza bought from his rival. Even after all this, in all this cut throat competition, this Asian man seeing me eat a pizza at his bar style ramen place gets me water. This leads me believe there are people in this world who can serve without profit.
