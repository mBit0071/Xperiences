I am driving a pickup truck. And I drove to look at sky in a desert. I have watched timelapse night sky videos and have always wanted to see them.

```
To put the desert on map, let's call it Joshua Tree National Park. 
I have never been to Joshua Tree, having lived to it so close, I feel pretty bad. 
But I would try to visit it soon. 335 has visited Joshua Tree National Park and told me that it is a nice place. 
Come to think of it, I have not been to Death Vally either, which is also a desert nearby. 
Now Mojave National Preserve is also on my list. Asking myself why I have never gone to desert national parks. 
I think it is becuase I percieve them as places with higher temperatures. I usually run hot. 
335 has called me "perishable" like fruits, which I found very funny, but true.

So, I reach the desert and park in middle of nowhere. I lie in the truck bed looking at the night sky. This was my first time looking at the night sky.


```
Well, to be honest, second. First time I saw a night sky like that was on Pacific Coast Highway.
```


An hour or two passes and I start hearing strange noises. I could not pin point where they were coming from. So, I get down to inspect. I see a bunch of wolves. I guess they wanted to hunt me. I fought them as they tried to bite me. I smash some of them pretty bad and they were squealing. A couple of them bit me on my shoulders and arm. 

Somehow I manage to chase them away, but badly injured I had to get some medical help. So, I drove to Downtown Los Angeles for help. I find out that all the doctors at that particular hospital are asleep and I would need to wait till morning to`get treated. And I wake up as I am going around town to get help!
