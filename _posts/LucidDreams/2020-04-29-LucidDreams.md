Going to my hometown requires me to hop a bigger city. Luckily my cousins live in one of the bigger cities and we usually spend the night (or a couple days) at their place. Usually we would arrive their place demolished from the travel and my cousins parents always welcome us with a smile. But this time it was different, I somehow reached early. And this time I am travelling with my sister. 


```
I have never travelled with my sister for some reason.

Anyways, we get in their home with a spare key and lie down in guest bedroom. But it was trickling (not raining, but small shower) and it was hot inside, so I try to get some air circulation going. I open the door balcony door and find it opening inside the building.

Then I walk to the passageway between the rooms and find a couple of windows directly opposite to the guest room\'s door, so I open those too. This worked surprisingly well, as I had it imagined in my brain. So, we lie for a bit and hear a gears in main door. As I reach the door, a random person appears and keep groceries on the table. For a second I think why is this guy not shocked that I\'m in his home just chilling. But soon after 422 arrives and behind him his wife and 381. 422 give me a handful of dried fruits as he enters.

```
397 is 381's brother but for some reason I did not expect him to arrive behind 381. 
Maybe because he is married and I consider him a new family.
```
So, all the traveller\'s sit down on sofa to relax. I can see their tired faces so I get to kitchen to get some water. And I wake up.
